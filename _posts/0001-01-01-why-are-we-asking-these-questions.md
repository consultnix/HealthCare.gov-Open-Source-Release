# About the Questions We’re Asking


## What we ask

We ask questions about the following topics. You can answer based on your situation or anybody else’s. 

 - State
 - Age group
 - Gender
 - Insurance status
 - Whether you’d like information on any of the following topics: dependents under 18, self-employment, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, membership in an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe, or pre- existing conditions.
 - Household size
 - Whether income falls above or below a certain level. (You may answer “I don’t know” to this question and still complete the process.)

## What you get

After you complete the questions you will get a page of results that includes: 
 
 - A list of health coverage options you may qualify for
 - Links to content that will help you make informed decisions
 - A personalized checklist to help you get ready to apply

## This is not the application for the Health Insurance Marketplace

The questions on these screens are not linked to the application for the Health Insurance Marketplace in any way. That application is not available until October 1, 2013. 

## What we do with the information we gather

We use the information to provide you with selected content that matches the situation you describe.

We don’t require you to provide any personally identifiable information (PII) during your visit. On your results page, you may provide us with your email address if you’d like to receive email updates about the Marketplace and other insurance topics. You are not required to do this.

We also use the aggregated information we gather to improve the experience for visitors to HealthCare.gov and carry out our site’s mission. We never share or sell information we gather to any outside parties. 

For more details about our policies for collecting, storing, and using information, read our [Privacy Notice](/privacy).
